# teararoa-gpx-split

This utility combines the **Tracks** and **Section Routes** gpx files from https://www.teararoa.org.nz/before-you-go/maps-and-notes-download/, as well as elevation data from https://www.gpsvisualizer.com/elevation and then splits into 78 smaller gpx files, one for each "Section" in the trail notes.  

Each file has the track, with elevation, waypoints for the start of each track from the Section Routes file, as well as km waypoints.  The file name begins with the start km, so the sections will be sorted north to south. 

I developed this tool to make it easy to navigate these sections on my Garmin watch.  To install, either copy the gpx files to \GARMIN\NewFiles on your Garmin watch, or use [Garmin Basecamp](https://www.garmin.com/en-NZ/software/basecamp/).
